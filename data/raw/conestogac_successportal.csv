https://successportal.conestogac.on.ca/s/peer-mental-wellness,1,"Peer Wellness Services We offer INFORMAL supportive listening and wellness activities to help support your mental wellness, encourage connection, and learn about resources available to you. Conestoga’s Peer Wellness Services are: Completely FREE Inclusive, engaging, and accessible for all! Drop-in based (meaning you don’t have to book an appointment) Confidential and non-judgemental What is Peer Support? Peer support is a supportive relationship between people who have a lived experience in common. Being a student is complex. Why not talk to someone who has been right where you are now! The Breathing Space The Breathing Space is a wellness-focused, inclusive space for students needing to take a break from their academics, destress, and access tools and resources to support their wellness. Within this space, Peer Wellness Navigators can provide a listening ear and, if needed, direct students to appropriate wellness resources. We encourage students to use the space for their wellness while following the guidelines. Locations: Kitchener - Doon Campus, Welcome Centre Room 104 Intended Use of the Breathing Space Recharge Wellness Space - Students may need a place to escape from the noise and stress of the school environment. The Breathing Space is intended for students to engage in self-care practices and take a break from academic work. Drop-In Activities - Participating in events and drop-in activities can build connections and give students an opportunity to learn about self-care techniques to help with wellness. Peer Wellness Connections - Students can utilize the Peer Wellness Navigators for discussions on supporting their wellness, learning about resources, and connecting with current students in a safe wellness environment. Guidelines for Using the Breathing Space The Breathing Space is intended to support wellness and is not a location to “hang out” or do group work. You may be asked to leave if you are not following the guidelines for use. Avoid Loud or Disruptive Activities - This space is intended for low noise activities. Group work, social hangouts, phone or video calling are not permitted. Disrespectful Attitudes and Opinions will Not be Tolerated - Respect for the space, the staff, and other students is a top priority. Behaviour not allowed includes harassment, crossing boundaries, disrespecting space, hurtful comments, etc. Avoid Attending Online Classes or Meetings . No Sleeping Allowed - While sleep/rest is a fantastic way to take care of yourself, this space is not meant to be a nap room. What is a Peer Wellness Navigator? Peer Wellness Navigators are current Conestoga students who use their lived experience with mental health and/or substance use to focus on building connections and sharing wellness tools, strategies, and resources. Peer Wellness Services are built around mutual respect and trust. No information or services shared in this space are intended to replace clinical wellness services such as counselling and medical. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified healthcare provider with any questions about your health or wellness if you have any concerns.

https://successportal.conestogac.on.ca/students/faqs/detail/93/disability-related-accommodati,1,"Disability-Related Accommodation Process Save Send Feedback The academic accommodation process is a collaborative effort between students and Accessible Learning. The goal is to reach agreement on appropriate accommodations, ensuring students have equitable access to their education. Faculty may be involved in this process as experts in academic requirements. While we do not share students’ health information with faculty, there are some accommodations where we may need to provide context about the barriers a student encounters in the academic environment to support the process. If students disagree with a decision, they have the right to appeal: As a first step, students should discuss their concerns with their Accessibility Advisor. If a student believes a decision was made in error, they may appeal to the Manager of Accessible Learning. Appeals are reviewed by a person not directly involved in the original decision to ensure fairness. Depending on the situation, appeals may be addressed to the Director of Advising, Accessibility & Testing, or the Dean of Students. If the decision was made by a faculty member, concerns should first be brought to the Program Chair, and if necessary, to the Dean. Students are also encouraged to review the Academic Dispute Resolution and Appeals policy, which outlines additional options for addressing academic concerns.

https://successportal.conestogac.on.ca/students/faqs/detail/93,1,"Disability-Related Accommodation Process Save Send Feedback The academic accommodation process is a collaborative effort between students and Accessible Learning. The goal is to reach agreement on appropriate accommodations, ensuring students have equitable access to their education. Faculty may be involved in this process as experts in academic requirements. While we do not share students’ health information with faculty, there are some accommodations where we may need to provide context about the barriers a student encounters in the academic environment to support the process. If students disagree with a decision, they have the right to appeal: As a first step, students should discuss their concerns with their Accessibility Advisor. If a student believes a decision was made in error, they may appeal to the Manager of Accessible Learning. Appeals are reviewed by a person not directly involved in the original decision to ensure fairness. Depending on the situation, appeals may be addressed to the Director of Advising, Accessibility & Testing, or the Dean of Students. If the decision was made by a faculty member, concerns should first be brought to the Program Chair, and if necessary, to the Dean. Students are also encouraged to review the Academic Dispute Resolution and Appeals policy, which outlines additional options for addressing academic concerns.

https://successportal.conestogac.on.ca/students/infopages/detail/12,1,"Understanding Math Anxiety Save Send Feedback [LINK: /students/experiences/add/from/infopage/1470053] Understanding math anxiety Math anxiety is more than just disliking math. Sometimes you may feel: Fear of making mistakes, lack of confidence in math. Fast heart beating, sweatiness, nausea when anticipating or engaging in math tasks. Wanting to quit when confused or making mistakes in math. Stress before evaluations such as tests, quizzes and exams. Nervous before math class. Procrastination of math homework or assignments. Unable to concentrate on a math task. Does math anxiety affect math ability? The video below explains more about what math anxiety is and does to your brain when you're experiencing it. Math anxiety and working memory Our working memory is a system in our brain responsible for temporarily storing and manipulating information and is essential when solving most math problems. Our working memory can store very limited amounts of information. The amount of information our working memory can store at one time is sometimes referred to a s cognitive load. When our cognitive load has reached its maximum capacity, we stop processing information. Elevated levels of anxiety can affect working memory, decreasing its efficiency. This is not permanent and only occurs for the duration of time that the anxiety lasts. Since math requires working memory, trying to do math under high levels of anxiety can at times feel impossible. So what does this mean? Anxiety can affect math performance no matter how good someone is at math. Our math skills may be just fine and we need to tackle the anxiety! When we learn to reduce the anxiety we feel when doing or anticipating math tasks, our working memory can process information much more easily and efficiently, making things seem more manageable. Myths about math Math comes with its stereotypes. Here are three things that are not true about math: People of different race and sex have varying innate math ability There is a best way to solve a math problem You have to have a 'math brain' to understand math Debunking math stereotypes can shed some positive light on the subject and our ability to improve our math skills. The next time you hear someone say any of the things above, remember they are not true! Strategies for overcoming and managing math anxiety The following strategies are things you can start doing today to help manage and overcome math anxiety. This list is not exhaustive and some things may work better for some people than others. There is no particular order in which you have to follow the strategies. Try whichever ones resonate best with you! Strengthen foundational math knowledge Math builds on itself. Imagine trying to calculate 5+7−4 without knowing how addition or subtractions works. This would be extremely difficult and could lead to things like lack of confidence, defeat, and frustration. Having strong foundational knowledge of the prerequisite skills needed for the math you are required to do will make things easier. When you attempt to solve a math problem without the required foundational knowledge, your working memory can become overloaded. Cognitive load is the amount of information that can be stored in working memory at one time. The weaker your foundational math knowledge is, the more resources are taken up in working memory when solving a math problem, increasing cognitive load and leaving fewer brain resources for the steps required to solve the problem at hand. With a stronger math foundation, more working memory resources can be allocated to solving the problem at hand, and less on trying to understand the basics at the same time. The stronger our basics, the more math confidence you can build. Not sure what foundational knowledge you need to strengthen?

Check out the tips below to help you start your math course with the right mindset. Get math help early Math builds on itself. Likely, what you learn in the first lesson of your math class will be needed throughout the course. Reach out to your instructor or book a math help appointment as soon as you are: Confused about a topic you learned in class. Stuck on a math practice problem. Preparing for a math test, quiz, etc. Remember, Conestoga provides [LINK: https://successportal.conestogac.on.ca/s/math] for eligible students. Follow your instructional plan Your instructional plan will give you an overview of the topics to be covered in your math course. Set aside some time to check over the plan before your class, so you know what topics will be covered. Even if these topics are new to you, it’s good to prepare yourself for what will come next. Don't skip the first class The first class is when the instructor explains the overview of the course, what their expectations are for students and what students can expect from the instructor. You will benefit from attending this first class for many reasons, including: Getting an overview of the course in a nutshell. Receiving information on free college resources (like math help!). Learning where to locate textbooks and class materials. Experiencing the first lesson. Meeting others in the class. Meeting your instructor. Learning the instructor's office hours. Explore your eConestoga course shell Every math class is different. It’s important to explore your eConestoga course shell for class notes, instructor announcements, and extra resources you may need during the course. Here are some things to explore in the course shell during the first week of classes: Location of class notes. Format of class notes (printable slides, videos, etc.). Calculator requirements. Pearson MyLab or Lyryx log in (if your instructor uses it). Online textbooks. Math help appointment booking instructions. Does your class use Pearson MyLab? The Study Plan feature is a great tool for extra practice and tracking progress. This [LINK: https://successportal.conestogac.on.ca/students/videos/detail/12] walks you through how to use the Study Plan feature. Explore math resources outside of class There are many free, useful math resources available outside of the classroom, from graphing technology to interactive mini-lessons.

With over 50,000 youth participating across the country, in multiple languages and reflecting Canada’s multicultural landscape, kids and youth in Scouts chart their own path of discovery.

Youth in Scouts are supported by a dedicated team of over 12,000 volunteers who collectively donate over two million hours of their time, providing youth with the opportunity to grow, to challenge themselves and to experience countless firsts. Our volunteers help us bring our vision of youth making meaningful contributions to creating a better world to life by lifting people, communities and neighbourhoods.  Scouts Canada is part of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) which has over 40 million members in 167 National Scout Organizations around the world. Overview of the Application Process Youth safety is at the core of everything we do. As Canada’s largest youth organization, Scouts Canada places great importance on creating a fun and safe environment for all our members, especially children and youth. We truly believe we have a responsibility to help make Canada safer for our children and youth. This is why adults appointed to positions of authority over youth undergo a vetting process which includes; an application form, interview, police record checks (including vulnerable sector searches), references and youth protection training with Respect in Sport. This process is designed to ensure that Scouters are suitable to occupy a position of trust, and to support this we have a detailed code of conduct as well as our Two Scouter rule which requires for two registered Scouters to be with youth at all times.
